# 🍷 Wine Quality Prediction Model

A machine learning project that predicts wine quality from physicochemical properties using the **Wine Quality** dataset. This repository contains the dataset and a Jupyter Notebook that demonstrates data exploration, model training and evaluation.

---

## 📄 Project Overview

Machine learning can be used to estimate wine quality based on chemical attributes like acidity, alcohol content, pH, sulphates, etc. In this repository, you’ll find:

- `Wine Quality Prediction.ipynb`: A Jupyter Notebook showing the end-to-end ML workflow.
- `winequality.csv`: The wine quality dataset.
  
The goal is to build a model that learns from existing data to predict wine quality scores accurately.

## 🧪 Dataset

This project uses the popular **Wine Quality** dataset, which contains physicochemical measurements of red/white wine samples and their corresponding quality scores.

Typical attributes include:

- Fixed acidity  
- Volatile acidity  
- Citric acid  
- Residual sugar  
- Chlorides  
- Free sulfur dioxide  
- Total sulfur dioxide  
- Density  
- pH  
- Sulphates  
- Alcohol  
- Quality (target variable)  

(The dataset often comes from the UCI Machine Learning Repository.) :contentReference[oaicite:2]{index=2}
